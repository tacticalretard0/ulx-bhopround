# ulx-bhopround

This is a custom [ULX](https://github.com/TeamUlysses/ulx) command for the Garry's Mod gamemode [Light Hide and Seek](https://github.com/Fafy2801/light-hns)

This command automatically enables auto bhop the round after it is run.

## TODO
* Add ULX voting
* Add support for Pointshop jumppack
* Add better autohop code
* Let players autohop when they join in the middle of the round
* Don't let spectators and players in noclip autohop
