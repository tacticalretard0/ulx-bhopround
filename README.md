# ulx-bhopround

This is a custom [ULX](https://github.com/TeamUlysses/ulx) command for the Garry's Mod gamemode [Light Hide and Seek](https://github.com/Fafy2801/light-hns)

This command automatically enables auto bhop the round after it is run.

## TODO
* Add ULX voting
* Add better autohop code
* Make jumppack hook shared
* Somehow find a way to not have to call PS_NumItemsEquippedFromCategory every time the move hook is run (I think it's slow)
